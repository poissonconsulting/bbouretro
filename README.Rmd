## Introduction
The goal of bbouretro is to provide the ability to calculate survival, recruitment and population growth using the traditional methods. 

## Installation

To install the latest version from [GitHub](https://github.com/poissonconsulting/bbouretro)

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("poissonconsulting/bbouretro")
```

## Example

```{r}
set.seed(101)

library(bbouretro)
library(bboudata)

# generate recruitment estimate for each year
recruitment_est <-
  bbr_recruitment(
    bboudata::bbourecruit_c,
    adult_female_proportion = 0.65,
    sex_ratio = 0.5,
    variance = "bootstrap"
  )
bbr_plot_recruitment(recruitment_est)

# generate survival estimate for each year
survival_est <-
  bbr_survival(
    bboudata::bbousurv_c,
    include_uncertain_morts = TRUE,
    variance = "greenwood"
  )
bbr_plot_survival(survival_est)

# calculate lambda now that both recruitment and survival have been calculated
growth_est <- bbr_growth(survival_est, recruitment_est)
summary <- bbr_growth_summarize(growth_est)
summary
bbr_plot_growth(growth_est)
bbr_plot_growth_distributions(growth_est)
```

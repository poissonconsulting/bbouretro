	abstract = {Trends in population grow th can be m onitored w ith data for key vital rates w ithout knowledge o f abundance. A lthough adult female survival has the highest elasticity for ungulate population dynamics, the m ore variable recruitm ent rates are com m only m onitored to track local variation in grow th rates. Specifically, recruitm ent is often m easured using late w in ter youngradult age ratios, th o u g h these age ratios are difficult to reliably interpret given the contribution o f m ultiple vital rates to annual ratios. W e show th at the supplem entation o f age ratio data w ith concurrent radio-telem etry m onitoring o f adult female survival allows both retrospective estim ation o f empirical population grow th rates and the decom position o f recruitm ent-specific vital rates. W e dem onstrate the estim ation o f recruitm ent and population grow th rates for 1 w oodland caribou population using these m ethods, including elasticity and life-stage sim ulation analysis o f the relative contribution o f adult female survival and recruitm ent rates to variation in population growth. W e show, for this w oodland caribou population, th at adult female survival and recruitm ent rates w ere nearly equivalent drivers o f population growth.
